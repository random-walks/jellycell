# Changelog

All notable changes to jellycell follow the [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/) format, and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

Versioning policy: **patch bumps are cheap**. See [docs/development/releasing.md](docs/development/releasing.md) for the full policy and the three §10 contracts that govern major bumps.

## [Unreleased]

## [1.0.0] — 2026-04-18

First public release.

### Features — notebook format

- **Plain-text `.py` notebooks** in jupytext percent format with PEP-723 headers. Jellycell strip-and-re-inserts the PEP-723 block so jupytext's round-trip is byte-exact.
- **Tag vocabulary** on `# %%` markers: `cell-id`, `name`, `kind`, `deps`, `timeout_s`. Parsed by `jellycell.format`; registry lives in `format/tags.py`.
- **`[tool.jellycell]` file-scope overrides** inside the PEP-723 block. Allow-listed keys: `project.name`, `run.kernel`, `run.timeout_seconds`. Unknown keys raise `UnknownOverrideKeyError` — no silent typos.

### Features — cache + run

- **Content-addressed per-cell cache.** Key = `sha256(source, sorted_dep_keys, env_hash, MINOR_VERSION)`. Stored as JSON manifests + diskcache blobs with a SQLite catalogue accelerator.
- **`jellycell run`** executes notebooks via a subprocess Jupyter kernel. Cache-hit cells skip execution; cache-miss cells stream outputs to the cache and write artifacts to `artifacts/`.
- **`jc.*` runtime API**: `save`, `load`, `figure`, `table`, `path`, `deps`, `cache`, `ctx`. Works inside a run (reads `RunContext`) and as a plain script (standalone mode).
- **`jc.cache` decorator** memoizes function calls via the same content-addressed store. Keys on `(qualname, normalized source, pickled args)`. Standalone mode is identity passthrough.
- **`jc.load()` registers an implicit dep edge** on the producing cell via the artifact lineage index — cross-notebook dataflow invalidates correctly without hand-written `deps=` tags.
- **Static AST walk for `jc.deps("a", "b")`.** The runner parses `jc.deps(...)` out of cell source *before* executing, so runtime-declared deps enter the current cell's cache key (not just downstream cells').
- **Lockfile-aware `env_hash`.** Prefers `uv.lock` / `poetry.lock` bytes over the PEP-723 dependency list. Two environments that resolve to different concrete versions no longer share a cache.
- **Artifact lineage reverse index** (`CacheIndex.find_producer`): "which cell produced this file?" via SQLite. Consumed by `jc.load` dep registration and `jc.path("name")` lookup.
- **Wall-clock kernel timeout.** `Kernel.execute` uses `time.monotonic()` for a true deadline — slow-drip output no longer outruns the cap.
- **`KernelPool`** reuses a single kernel across multiple `Runner.run()` calls for batch scripts and `render_all`. Opt-in via `Runner(project, kernel_pool=pool)`. Default stays fresh-per-run for isolation.
- **`jellycell cache`** subcommands: `list`, `clear`, `prune` (`--older-than` / `--keep-last` / `--dry-run`), `rebuild-index`.

### Features — lint + config

- **`jellycell lint`** with fixers: `layout`, `pep723-position`, `enforce-artifact-paths`, `enforce-declared-deps`, `warn-on-large-cell-output`.
- **`jellycell init`** scaffolds a project with `jellycell.toml`, the canonical directory layout, and a starter notebook.
- **`jellycell new <name>`** scaffolds a new notebook from the starter template.

### Features — render + view

- **`jellycell render`** produces self-contained HTML under `reports/`. Templates use jinja2; code highlighting via Pygments; markdown via markdown-it-py + MyST plugins.
- **`jellycell view`** (needs `[server]` extra) serves a Starlette + SSE app with live-reload on file changes. Routes: `/`, `/nb/<stem>`, `/artifacts/<...>`, `/_assets/<...>`, `/api/state.json`, `/events`. Read-only.
- **Unified asset layout** (`reports/_assets/`): static render and the live server share one content-addressed asset tree. HTML is byte-identical across both paths.
- **Security warning on non-loopback `jellycell view`.** Binding `--host 0.0.0.0` (or any non-`127.0.0.1`/`localhost`/`::1` host) prints a banner about the exposure.

### Features — export

- **`jellycell export ipynb <nb>`** produces a runnable `.ipynb` with cached outputs reattached. `execution_count` matches nbformat convention (last `execute_result`, not first).
- **`jellycell export md <nb>`** produces MyST markdown for Sphinx / Jupyter Book integration.
- **`jellycell export tearsheet <nb>`** writes a curated markdown tearsheet to `manuscripts/tearsheets/<stem>.md` by default (override with `-o PATH`). The `tearsheets/` subfolder convention keeps auto-generated output separate from hand-authored writeups (paper drafts, memos, thesis chapters) that live at the root of `manuscripts/`. Pulls markdown cell prose, inlines image artifacts via relative paths, and flattens JSON summaries into two-column tables. Header block labels the file as a tearsheet with a link to the source notebook, to `reports/<stem>.html` when it exists, and the last-run timestamp. Safe to commit — GitHub renders it inline. Example tearsheets ship under `examples/*/manuscripts/tearsheets/`.

### Features — agent surface

- **`jellycell prompt`** emits the canonical agent guide — a single markdown doc covering layout, format, tags, API, and CLI reference. Content is the §10.3 stability contract; pinned by a regression snapshot.
- Every CLI command supports `--json` with a versioned schema (§10.1). Shapes pinned by per-command regression snapshots.

### Docs + infra

- Docs on Read the Docs: getting-started, file-format, project-layout, cli-reference, agent-guide, plus the frozen v0 spec and dev guides.
- Examples: `minimal/`, `demo/`, `timeseries/`. CI runs every example notebook end-to-end.
- Claude Code infra: CLAUDE.md, slash commands (`/spec-check`, `/phase-status`), subagents, skills (`spec-invariant`, `phase-budget`, `piggyback-first`).
- Release pipeline on PyPI via trusted publisher (OIDC).

### Features — live viewer: disk-write-free + response cache + long-lived env

`jellycell view` no longer writes HTML pages to disk on request. The
server is a read-only view over notebooks + cache; `jellycell render`
is the only thing that populates `site/`. Three coupled changes:

- **In-memory rendering** — `Renderer` gains a `write_pages: bool = True`
  kwarg (default preserves CLI behavior) and returns the HTML string
  via `RenderedNotebook.html` / new `RenderedIndex.html` when pages
  aren't written. The server uses `write_pages=False` and streams
  responses straight from memory.
- **Response cache** — per-notebook in-memory cache in `_ServerState`,
  keyed by `CacheIndex.notebook_view_key(project_root, rel)` — the
  sha256 of the notebook's source bytes combined with its ordered cell
  cache keys. Any edit (source) or any run (new manifests) rotates the
  key, so the cache is always correct without explicit busting. Index
  page caches off a rollup of every notebook's view-key.
- **Long-lived `RendererEnv`** — Jinja templates + Pygments CSS +
  assets dir bundle built once at server startup via
  `RendererEnv.for_server(project)` and reused across all requests.
  Per-request still opens short-lived `CacheStore` / `CacheIndex`
  handles so SQLite stays thread-local. `for_static(project)` is the
  CLI factory.
- **Assets relocated for the live path** — the `/_assets/` mount now
  points at `.jellycell/cache/assets/` (content-addressed, always
  git-ignored). `site/_assets/` stays the static-CLI-only destination.
  If you use both modes, you get assets in both places — small files,
  content-hashed filenames dedupe within each tree, no sync logic.
- **`JELLYCELL_VIEW_NOCACHE=1`** env var disables the response cache
  for template-iteration workflows.

§10 contracts: none touched. Pure additive / backwards-compatible
API — default `Renderer()` call writes to disk as before.

### Renamed — `reports/` → `site/`

Clearer separation from `manuscripts/`. The old name conflated HTML
output with "the report I'm writing" (which lives in `manuscripts/`
now). **The new mental model**:

- `manuscripts/` — prose for humans + GitHub (markdown, committed).
- `site/` — rendered HTML catalogue for browsers (`.html`, `_assets/`,
  optional to commit).
- Both are outputs; neither is source. Edit `notebooks/`, regenerate.

Concretely: `PathsConfig.reports → site`, `Project.reports_dir →
site_dir`. The `jellycell export tearsheet` HTML-report link checks
``site/<stem>.html`` first, falls back to the legacy ``reports/<stem>.html``
so pre-rename projects still get the cross-link. `jellycell.toml`
field renamed — existing configs need `reports = …` swapped to
`site = …` (pydantic rejects the old field name; clean break).

### Features — live viewer lifts (manuscripts + journal + tearsheet nav)

- **Manuscript previewer**: new `/manuscripts/` landing page + dynamic
  `/manuscripts/<path>.md` route serves any markdown under
  `manuscripts/` through the project's template stack. Authored
  writeups, auto-generated tearsheets, and the journal all render
  in-browser with the same chrome as notebook pages.
- **Journal viewer**: `/journal` is a first-class route aliasing the
  configured journal file. Live-reloads on every `jellycell run`
  through the existing watchfiles → SSE pipeline so the trajectory
  appears in-browser as it's written.
- **Tearsheet ↔ notebook cross-links**: each notebook HTML page now
  shows a `Tearsheet →` button when `manuscripts/tearsheets/<stem>.md`
  exists; tearsheet pages show a matching `Notebook →` link when the
  source notebook is present. One click to flip between source and
  curated summary.
- **Per-tearsheet prev/next navigation**: when browsing a tearsheet,
  the header carries `← previous / next →` links to the adjacent
  tearsheets in alphabetical order. Authored writeups don't get the
  prev/next pair since they're standalone documents.
- **Sidebar reorganization on manuscript pages**: three groups
  (Authored / Tearsheets / Log) with the active page highlighted.
- **Targeted SSE reloads**: `manuscripts/**/*.md` edits now publish a
  `ReloadEvent` for the specific page (`/manuscripts/<path>` or
  `/journal`) instead of broadly reloading the index.
- **`/api/state.json`** gains a `manuscripts` payload
  (authored + tearsheets + journal catalog). Additive — no
  `schema_version` bump.

### Features — artifact metadata + journal + checkpoint

- **Artifact metadata via `jc.*` kwargs** — `jc.save`, `jc.figure`, and
  `jc.table` accept optional `caption="..."`, `notes="..."`, `tags=[...]`.
  Captured in the `ArtifactRecord` inside the cell manifest (additive
  optional fields; §10.1 safe — no `schema_version` bump, no
  `MINOR_VERSION` bump). Tearsheets render caption as the figure /
  table heading, notes as an italic subcaption, tags as a searchable
  line below.
- **Analysis journal** — `manuscripts/journal.md` gets one append-only
  section per `jellycell run`: timestamp, notebook, cell counts,
  duration, new artifacts (with captions), large-artifact warnings,
  any errors, and the optional `-m "..."` message. Default-on (opt-out
  via `[journal] enabled = false`). Append-only from jellycell's side
  so hand-edited commentary survives future runs. New `-m / --message`
  flag on `jellycell run`.
- **`jellycell checkpoint`** — reproducible `.tar.gz` snapshots with
  `create`, `list`, `restore` subcommands. Archives notebooks, data,
  artifacts, reports, manuscripts, `jellycell.toml`, and
  `.jellycell/cache/`. Junk dirs (`__pycache__`, `.venv`, `.git`, etc.)
  are skipped. **Restore is safe by default**: lands in a new sibling
  directory (`<project>-restored-<name>/`) so the live project is
  never touched. `--into PATH` lets you pick a location; `--force` is
  required to merge into a non-empty target.
- **Contracts doc clarification** — [reference/contracts](docs/reference/contracts.md)
  now makes explicit that additive optional fields on manifest schemas
  are backwards-compatible (no `MINOR_VERSION` bump) so long as
  defaults preserve old-manifest deserialization.

### Features — artifact layout + large-file handling

- **`[artifacts]` config section** in `jellycell.toml`:
  - **`layout`** (`"flat"` / `"by_notebook"` / `"by_cell"`, default
    `"flat"`): controls where path-less `jc.figure()` / `jc.table()`
    writes. `"by_cell"` makes every artifact path name its producer
    (`artifacts/<notebook>/<cell>/<name>.<ext>`) — agent-friendly for
    "what generated what" lookups. Explicit `jc.save(x, "...")` paths
    always win, so existing notebooks keep working unchanged.
  - **`max_committed_size_mb`** (default `50`): post-run soft threshold.
    `jellycell run` flags any single artifact above the limit with a
    `.gitignore` / Git LFS reminder. Set to `0` to disable.
- **New `large-data` example** under `examples/large-data/`
  demonstrates the full pattern: `[artifacts] layout = "by_notebook"`,
  low `max_committed_size_mb`, a tiny committed `headline.json` digest
  next to a git-ignored generated parquet, and a reproducible seed so
  reviewers regenerate locally.
- **Additive `RunReport.large_artifacts` field** — a list of
  `LargeArtifactWarning` entries surfaced to both the JSON and rich
  outputs of `jellycell run`. §10.1 additive (no `schema_version` bump).

### Examples — READMEs + hand-authored manuscripts

Every example now ships a top-level `README.md` with bootstrap commands
(both `uv` and `pip`), a layout diagram, and "what this example shows."
Every example's `manuscripts/` folder carries a hand-authored
`.md` alongside the auto-generated tearsheet(s):

- `minimal/manuscripts/notes.md` — first-run reflection.
- `demo/manuscripts/analysis.md` — analyst's read on the conversion numbers.
- `paper/manuscripts/paper.md` — paper draft (already existed; now cross-linked).
- `timeseries/manuscripts/findings.md` — interpretation of decomposition + forecast.
- `ml-experiment/manuscripts/model-card.md` — training-run log.
- `large-data/manuscripts/data-notes.md` — reproducibility protocol.

### Contracts locked (§10)

1. **`--json` schemas** (`schema_version: 1`). Pinned by `tests/integration/test_json_schemas.py`.
2. **Cache key algorithm** (`MINOR_VERSION = 1`). Pinned by `tests/unit/test_hashing.py`.
3. **Agent guide content** (`jellycell prompt`). Pinned by `tests/unit/test_prompt_snapshot.py`.

Each contract has a documented ceremony for changes — see [docs/development/releasing.md](docs/development/releasing.md) and CLAUDE.md.

### Known limitations

- `cache prune` removes manifests but not blobs. diskcache deduplicates content-addressed storage so disk impact is small; a ref-counted blob GC lands in a future release.
- `jc.cache` argument hashing uses pickle. Unpicklable inputs raise clearly at call time; a JSON-default fallback can come later.
